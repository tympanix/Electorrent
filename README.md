## FAQ
 * **Your program sucks. It doesn't support my bittorrent client**

 What an opportunity! Now open an issue telling me which bittorrent client you would like to see next :)

 * **What kind of technologies are used to build this?**

 The application is build around [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [SemanticUI](http://semantic-ui.com/)

* **I can't connect to rTorrent what is wrong?**

 When using rTorrent you have to configure your http server correctly. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent/wiki/RPC-Setup-XMLRPC) to make sure you have it set up correctly. Alternative you may be able to use `/plugins/httprpc/action.php` as the path if your have the HTTPRPC plugin installed.
