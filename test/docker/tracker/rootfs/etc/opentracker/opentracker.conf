# opentracker config file
#

# I)   Address opentracker will listen on, using both, tcp AND udp family
#      (note, that port 6969 is implicite if ommitted).
#
#      If no listen option is given (here or on the command line), opentracker
#      listens on 0.0.0.0:6969 tcp and udp.
#
#      The next variable determines if udp sockets are handled in the event
#      loop (set it to 0, the default) or are handled in blocking reads in
#      dedicated worker threads. You have to set this value before the
#      listen.tcp_udp or listen.udp statements before it takes effect, but you
#      can re-set it for each listen statement. Normally you should keep it at
#      the top of the config file.
#
# listen.udp.workers 4
#
# listen.tcp_udp 0.0.0.0
# listen.tcp_udp 192.168.0.1:80
# listen.tcp_udp 10.0.0.5:6969
#
#      To only listen on tcp or udp family ports, list them this way:
#
# listen.tcp 0.0.0.0
# listen.udp 192.168.0.1:6969
#
#      Note, that using 0.0.0.0 for udp sockets may yield surprising results.
#      An answer packet sent on that socket will not necessarily have the
#      source address that the requesting client may expect, but any address
#      on that interface.
#

# II)  If opentracker runs in a non-open mode, point it to files containing
#      all torrent hashes that it will serve (shell option -w)
#
# access.whitelist /etc/opentracker/whitelist.txt
#
#      or, if opentracker was compiled to allow blacklisting (shell option -b)
#
# access.blacklist /etc/opentracker/blacklist.txt
#
#      It is pointless and hence not possible to compile black AND white
#      listing, so choose one of those options at compile time. File format
#      is straight forward: "<hex info hash>\n<hex info hash>\n..."
#
#      If you do not want to grant anyone access to your stats, enable the
#      WANT_RESTRICT_STATS option in Makefile and bless the ip addresses
#      allowed to fetch stats here.
#
# access.stats 192.168.0.23
#
#      There is another way of hiding your stats. You can obfuscate the path
#      to them. Normally it is located at /stats but you can configure it to
#      appear anywhere on your tracker.
#
# access.stats_path stats

# III) Live sync uses udp multicast packets to keep a cluster of opentrackers
#      synchronized. This option tells opentracker which port to listen for
#      incoming live sync packets. The ip address tells opentracker, on which
#      interface to join the multicast group, those packets will arrive.
#      (shell option -i 192.168.0.1 -s 9696), port 9696 is default.
#
# livesync.cluster.listen 192.168.0.1:9696
#
#      Note that two udp sockets will be opened. One on ip address 0.0.0.0
#      port 9696, that will join the multicast group 224.0.42.23 for incoming
#      udp packets and one on ip address 192.168.0.1 port 9696 for outgoing
#      udp packets.
#
#      As of now one and only one ip address must be given, if opentracker
#      was built with the WANT_SYNC_LIVE feature.
#

# IV)  Sync between trackers running in a cluster is restricted to packets
#      coming from trusted ip addresses. While source ip verification is far
#      from perfect, the authors of opentracker trust in the correct
#      application of tunnels, filters and LAN setups (shell option -A).
#
# livesync.cluster.node_ip 192.168.0.4
# livesync.cluster.node_ip 192.168.0.5
# livesync.cluster.node_ip 192.168.0.6
#
#      This is the admin ip address for old style (HTTP based) asynchronus
#      tracker syncing.
#
# batchsync.cluster.admin_ip 10.1.1.1
#

# V)   Control privilege drop behaviour.
#      Put in the directory opentracker will chroot/chdir to. All black/white
#      list files must be put in that directory (shell option -d).
#
#
# tracker.rootdir /usr/local/etc/opentracker
#
#      Tell opentracker which user to setuid to.
#
# tracker.user    nobody
#

# VI)  opentracker can be told to answer to a "GET / HTTP"-request with a
#      redirect to another location (shell option -r).
